           Hello! My name is Hunter Hudson and I am a Junior at UNO studying Management of Information Systems with a focus in Information Assurance!
           I enjoy playing video games in my spare time, as well as mess around with PC hardware and software. I've built seven different desktops and have
           grown my understanding of electronics over time. I run my own Minecraft server with a friend from my living room using another desktop I built a 
           couple of years ago.
